--Thanks for improving the macro (if you did)

This is an auto macro for the weekly challenge "Turkey hunt" in roblox tower heroes. Use with tinytask.
*It is useful for getting candy mimic and golden turkey*

if you didn't know how to use tinytask on roblox:
- when played, don't move your character and your screen so the mouse can work.
- my ver has some issues like miss the upgrades on dumpster. If you spotted the error, fix it.

*equip these towers in order:
1.dumpster child
2.kart kid
3.*blank*
4.spectre
5.*blank*
